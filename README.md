# DAMG6210-Project


Multi-Tenant Property Management Platform

Mission Statement
To deliver a secure and scalable SaaS platform that enables property managers to efficiently oversee multiple properties, streamline tenant interactions, manage financial transactions, and ensure transparent communication, while maintaining data isolation and robust role-based access control.

Mission Objectives
The database will support and achieve the following mission objectives:
•	Property Information Management: Store and manage data related to multiple buildings, units, and facilities.
•	Tenant Management: Maintain detailed records of tenant profiles, lease agreements, and rental histories.
•	Maintenance Request Tracking: Log, process, and monitor tenant service requests, including assignment to technicians and status reporting.
•	Payment Processing: Record rent, utilities, and fee payments, manage billing cycles, and track overdue balances.
•	Document Management: Enable secure storage and retrieval of digital documents such as lease agreements, notices, inspection reports, and compliance certificates.
•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensure controlled access so that property managers, tenants, accountants, and maintenance staff only access relevant data.
•	Data Isolation: Support multi-tenancy by isolating each property owner's or manager's data, preventing cross-access between clients.
•	Communication Management: Facilitate structured messaging and notifications between tenants, management, and service providers.
•	Reporting and Analytics: Provide dashboards for revenue summaries, occupancy rates, maintenance metrics, and tenant satisfaction insights.
•	Scalability and SaaS Delivery: Support multiple property management companies with seamless onboarding, user growth, and efficient resource usage.
